This project is on detecting fraud accounts on twitter using Machine Learning Algorithms                                                                                       
We used Machine Learning algorithms to group real and fake users on twitter. The ML algorithms which are implemented in this project are                                                                                                           
1) Multinomial Naive bayes                                                                                                                                                 
2) KNN(K- Nearest Neighbour)                                                                                                                                               
3) Linear SVC(Support Vector Classifier)                                                                                                                                   
These algorithms will calculate the error rate and accuracy of the datasets and predict the fraud account users. The model metrics includes confusion matrix, accuracy score, classification report, precision scores, recall score and f1 scores to measure the fitness of the data. Data visualization methods are used to compare the algorithms accuracy that will be shown as output. The required libraries are - tkinter, pandas, numpy, matplotlib etc( pip install ). The complete code is written in python. The CSV dataset is taken from kaggle. Also a manual entry can be done to detect the users. But inorder to do that, first we need to train our models with the data so that they can determine the user account type.

The code is pretty simple and one can easily run it on their computer if there is Jupyter notebook in their system. 
Here are the software and Hardware requirements:

Software: OS: Windows 10 Jupyter Notebook Python

Hardware: RAM: 8GB Processor: Intel i5 Graphics: 4GB

The above mentioned requirements are not mandatory so you do not need to be bothered if your computer does not have these specifications, you can also run on a low configuration system too but it just takes a bit more time to get executed.

Please note that this code is only the backend to the fraud users detection on twitter, in order to use this code professionally, there has to be a decent frontend GUI.

Explore and Enjoy.
Happy coding.
